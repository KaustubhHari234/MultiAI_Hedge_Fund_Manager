### üöÄ Test / Use the Product ?

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KaustubhHari234/MultiAI_Hedge_Fund_Manager.git
cd MultiAI_Hedge_Fund_Manager
```

#### 2. Set up API keys

Create a `.env` file for your API keys:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys (in the root directory)
cp .env.example .env
```

Open and edit the `.env` file to add your API keys:
```bash
# For running LLMs hosted by openai (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, etc.)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# For getting financial data to power the hedge fund
FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
```

**Important**: You must set at least one LLM API key (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`) for the hedge fund to work. 

## 3. Install dependencies and run the application
1. Install Poetry (if not already installed):
```bash
pip install poetry
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

#### Run the AI Hedge Fund
```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```

You can also specify a `--ollama` flag to run the AI hedge fund using local LLMs.

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --ollama
```

You can optionally specify the start and end dates to make decisions over a specific time period.

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01
```

#### Run the Backtester
```bash
poetry run python src/backtester.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```
